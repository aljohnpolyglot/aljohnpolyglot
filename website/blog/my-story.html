                <h1>I Speak 11 Languages by 21—Here’s How I Did It! (The Full Story)</h1>
                <p class="blog-post-meta">By Aljohn Polyglot | Published: May 6, 2025</p>

                <img src="../images/aljohn_portrait.png" alt="Aljohn Polyglot Portrait" class="featured-image">

                <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Aljohn. I’m 21, and I currently speak 11 languages. So it might seem like I’ve been immersed in languages my whole life, but I actually got into it in 2021, not long after the pandemic hit. Before that, I was fluent in three languages: Tagalog, Bisaya, and of course English. It is pretty common to have those many languages if you live in the Philippines and it is not that special, I would say.</p>
                <p>But the other languages like Spanish, French, etc., actually came later, starting in August of 2021. So if you do the math, it’s been almost four years of learning, and as you can see in my videos, I try to go beyond the usual catchphrases you often hear from polyglots online. Instead of just repeating lines like “Aku belajar bahasa Indonesia” or “Hablo un poco de español,” “Oui, je parle français,” I focus on using these languages in real conversations, diving into more diverse topics. And I think I no longer have to prove anything as I have already done enough videos to back my claim.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If you want to learn languages in a short amount of time, then be ready to lose everything. Be ready to watch losing your friends as you obsess over words that no one around you understands. Be ready for your grades to drop, your relationships crumble—because once you start thinking in another language, you stop thinking like the person you used to be. Be ready to chase fluency like a madman... This isn’t just picking up a new skill; it is warping your identity, tearing apart the life you thought was already your life. And once you cross that line… there’s no going back. This is my story… on how language learning built and destroyed my entire life.
                </blockquote>

                <h2>THE ORDINARY, YET CURIOUS CHILD</h2>
                <p>So, when I was a child, I was ordinary—but not "normal." Ordinary in the sense that I did what society expected: I had routines, hobbies, and a happy childhood. But "normal"? I don’t think so. I was so fond of filling my curiosity and learning a lot of stuff. While others played games, I memorized 100 digits of pi (though only 50 digits remain now) and studied every country’s flag.</p>
                <p>And that is just two of the things I studied; because I studied a lot. Like a lot. My dad always yelled at me; not for “not studying” like a normal family does but because I was always studying and not helping with chores. When summer vacation came, I’d cry if we went out of town because my study routine would be interrupted. At the beach, I’d hide in the cottage, untouched by the sea, reading Carl Sagan's <em>Cosmos</em> on my Mom’s phone (I didn’t have my own then).</p>
                <p>On normal days, I watched Khan Academy math lessons, ranted about black holes with Neil deGrasse Tyson, watched NatGeo documentaries, and read Stephen Hawking’s <em>A Brief History of Time</em>. Since I didn't have a phone 24/7, I often sneaked into the mall bookstore to read, treating it like a library. I also dabbled in Duolingo’s Spanish tree, more to feel productive than to become fluent. Learning wasn’t just something I did; it was who I was. The idea of sitting still, of not feeding my mind, felt unbearable.</p>
                
                <h2>FINDING BALANCE AND NEW PASSIONS</h2>
                <p>That habit stayed with me through Junior High School. I was always looking for new things to learn. I'd go to school three hours early sometimes just so my friend Mike could teach me how to draw a portrait. My spare money went to books and art materials. I still didn’t have a personal phone, learning everything from the internet via computer, which I think helped build a long attention span crucial for language learning later.</p>
                <p>But I wasn’t a loner. I liked being social, especially with those sharing my interests. I was even President of the student government. Friends pulled me into karaoke nights and mall trips, which became our routine. My life felt balanced.</p>
                <p>My passion for learning science faded, replaced by a love for performing—acting, singing, music theory, learning instruments. I dreamt of being an actor. I also learned video editing for the school paper, building foundational skills I use now for my YouTube channel. Yes, contrary to some comments, I edit my own videos, including the special effects and sound design.</p>
                <p>Then, it was 2020, and the pandemic hit…</p>

                <h2>THE PANDEMIC</h2>
                <p>With free time, I fell back into my old study routine. I improved my Photoshop skills, creating viral visual illustrations with social commentary, which even led to commissions. After getting bored with that, I focused on physical health for the first time. I set strict routines and diets, learning about nutrition, macros, and memorizing calorie counts. I trained 6 hours a day, achieved the physique I wanted, and learned about discipline and sports science.</p>
                <p>When that phase ended, I needed a new goal. Browsing YouTube, I saw an interview with Matt vs. Japan mentioning Stephen Krashen’s theory: "We don’t learn languages, we acquire them." It clicked. My English fluency didn't come from school, but from binge-watching Cartoon Network, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, and movies like <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>. I didn't "study" English; I acquired it. So, I wondered: What if I tried that with Spanish? That became my new goal, and that’s when everything started.</p>

                <h2>THE BEGINNING OF LANGUAGE LEARNING</h2>
                <p>It began in August 2021, on my sister’s birthday. I started learning Spanish, armed only with vague memories from Duolingo years ago and the concept of language acquisition. I was clueless.</p>
                <p>I took Matt vs. Japan’s advice on using <strong>Anki</strong> (a game-changer I still use daily) and watched courses by Stephen Krashen and Steve Kaufmann on Comprehensible Input. My goal wasn't to be a polyglot, just to learn Spanish. Being a polyglot was never the goal; it just happened language by language.</p>
                <p>I got my own phone around this time, making learning accessible 24/7. My first resource was the <strong>Language Transfer</strong> course (finished in three days – highly effective!). Then, I started reading <em>Harry Potter</em> in Spanish. It took a month and a half, slow at first, but progress came.</p>
                <p>I created a separate Google account just for Spanish content to train the algorithm and drowned myself in Spanish YouTube videos (like Luisito Comunica) with Spanish subtitles. It was fast, requiring frequent pausing, but comprehension improved.</p>
                <p>All this happened while taking online college classes, which I gave minimal effort to. I couldn't focus; Spanish consumed my thoughts. Instead of lectures, I drilled verb conjugations on SpanishDict. New vocabulary and grammar rules went straight into my <strong>Anki</strong> deck, which I made myself for better context recall (like knowing 'cucumber' in Russian from Peppa Pig!). I reviewed flashcards every morning – aiming for 50-100 new words <strong>per day</strong>, not the slow 10 words often recommended. I hit 1000 words in about 10 days.</p>
                <p>I joined Discord groups, met fellow Filipinos like Iceah (who learned Spanish watching <em>Caso Cerrado</em> – proof of acquisition!), and made my first Latino friend, Noel from Argentina, who tolerated my broken Spanish.</p>
                <p>Discovering that B1 fluency needed ~300 hours spurred me to increase my study time from 5 hours to 10-12 hours daily, taking advantage of online classes for multitasking. I tracked my hours using color-coded graph paper (violet for reading, green for watching, orange for listening). By mid-October, after ~300 hours, I had my first full Spanish call with Noel. I hit 500 hours by December.</p>
                <p>By then, Spanish felt effortless. Fluency achieved (though far from native perfection). I was already bored and started learning French, ready for the next challenge. That same month, introduced by Iceah, I joined the Club de Hispanohablantes Filipinos – my closest friends now, who pushed me to improve.</p>

                <h2>SACRIFICING EVERYTHING</h2>
                <p>What about college? Mediocre. I sacrificed it for my daily language study quota. I even missed a Final Exam because I didn't check Messenger, prioritizing intense study. I had no regrets (though thankfully, a kind professor let me retake it). This lack of regret signaled a change in my character: language learning was the only priority. I started keeping a diary in my learned languages to practice, a habit I maintain today.</p>

                <h2>THE RACE AGAINST TIME</h2>
                <p>Language learning became a war against myself. Knowing 300 hours yielded decent fluency, I decided to speedrun. I designed a relentless 12-hour daily routine: 5 AM wake-up (inspired by Juanpa Zurita), 9 PM bedtime. Early mornings felt meditative, like I owned the world.</p>
                <p>I eliminated distractions. Messenger was gone (5 mins/day access). I locked myself in my room, online classes playing unheard in the background. Was it obsession? Maybe, but I was happy.</p>
                <p>Recap of progress:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aug-Nov 2021: Spanish</li>
                    <li>Dec 2021-Mar 2022: French</li>
                    <li>Mar-May 2022: Indonesian</li>
                    <li>May-Oct 2022: Russian</li>
                    <li>Oct-Nov 2022: Italian</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each language felt like a battle won, immersing myself in cultures I didn't belong to but felt attached to, making friends, consuming thousands of hours of content. My Google Chrome showed Russian ads; I used VK and Telegram. I applied for an Indonesian mentorship program. I developed niche interests (Indonesian singers Lyodra/Raisa, skater Kamila Valieva, French show Star Academy) with no one local to discuss them with. You probably don't know what I'm talking about – that's the point.</p>
                <p>My routine evolved: wake up at 2 AM for intense focus, sleep at 6 PM. Morning study felt like heaven. 2:00-~2:30 AM: Anki review. ~2:30-3:00 AM: Diary writing. 3:00-5:00 AM: Reading during breakfast. 5:30-8:00 AM: Calisthenics while listening to podcasts. By 8 AM, I'd logged 5 hours before most people woke up.</p>
                <p>Second meal around 8 AM while watching videos. Bath, then more immersion (YouTube, VPN for restricted content). Note-taking vocabulary and structures. If bored, call friends on Tandem/Discord. 4:00 PM until sleep (~6 PM): Second reading session. College homework or chores maybe took an hour total – not a priority.</p>
                <p>I believed learning a language in 1-3 months was possible if prioritized above all else. I couldn't understand why others were slow. "Impossible" felt like a word for the weak.</p>

                <h2>DISCONNECTION AND ISOLATION</h2>
                <p>Immersed in foreign languages, I felt disconnected from the Philippines. Hearing Tagalog felt strange. I didn't care about my country; I didn't even vote in the presidential election – a waste of study time.</p>
                <p>My old friends faded. I stopped checking messages, forgot about them. It hindered progress. In June 2023, I went to a close friend's birthday celebration but couldn't focus, glued to my phone reading Russian stories at the Mall of Asia. At 6 PM, stuck in traffic, I had a tantrum, crying about needing to sleep for my 2 AM wake-up. That was the last friend event I attended.</p>
                <p>My sister’s debut ended at 8 PM, two hours past my bedtime. I had a meltdown, destroying decorations, yelling. Sleep deprivation was the enemy. Another close friend's 18th birthday clashed with my Italian studies; I didn't go. I searched for nearby hotels to sleep but chose my goal. She understood.</p>
                <p>Why? It took time, and violated my rule: NO native language thoughts or usage. Everything – thoughts, content consumption, exercise – had to be in the target language. Every second was a battle. Don't break the routine: 2 AM wake-up, 6 PM sleep, all time studying.</p>
                <p>I realized language learning required understanding the culture – common knowledge, celebrities, music, geography. I memorized Paris maps, Jakarta train stations, football clubs. I discussed Eden Hazard's career with a Belgian. I became a monk, disconnected. The Filipino me was a memory. Normal pleasures brought no joy, only the grind of learning. I ghosted everyone. Language was my only friend.</p>
                <p>In November 2022, I created my YouTube channel, Aljohn Polyglot, showing the polished product, not the obsessed "monster" behind it who sacrificed sanity and connection. I became a ghost, barely human, fragmented by multiple linguistic identities.</p>

                <h2>WHEN I WANTED TO SEE THE WORLD BURN</h2>
                <p>December 2022, I started Portuguese with the same routine. Then my biggest fear: face-to-face classes announced for January 2023. No more online loopholes. How could I study?</p>
                <p>My blood boiled. Students had voted "yes"? Sabotage! Enemies! I briefly imagined violence. My goal was threatened. Christmas and New Year? I slept through them, sticking to my 2 AM/6 PM schedule. Special days weren't special to me.</p>
                <p>Enrollment week was torture – endless lines wasting precious minutes. Instead of waiting hours for an ID, I forged one in five minutes. Risky? Yes. Worth it? Absolutely (at the time). I got away with it, initially.</p>
                <p>Classes started. I was a loner, focused on languages. The loophole: AirPods for listening immersion during lectures, pretending to listen. Sometimes, if the professor wasn't attentive, I'd sneak reading practice on my phone (ReadEra app). Exams? Finish in 5 minutes to maximize study time. My classmates laughed; I didn't care about grades. A 6 PM exam clashed with bedtime; I sped through it, got home late, slept poorly, but kept the routine mostly intact.</p>
                <p>School was miserable. The noise during vacant periods was unbearable. My tracked study time dropped by ~2 hours daily due to school distractions and occasional focus on important lectures. I fantasized about shutting the school down. A bomb? Too risky. A new pandemic, COVID-22? How? I lacked the biology knowledge. A regret – not being able to start a pandemic slowed my progress. I didn't care if millions died; study time was the only priority. But I couldn't do it, so I endured.</p>

                <h2>I GOT CAUGHT!</h2>
                <p>May 2023, learning Swedish. The fake ID scheme finally failed, one week before finals. Punishment: 30 hours of community service at the school clinic. Forging saved hours, but the punishment cost 30. A miscalculation. The irony: an educational institution punishing prioritizing learning! I snuck in Swedish podcast listening during service.</p>
                <p>August 2023 enrollment: my new schedule stretched to 6 PM! Ruined my system. Solution? Transferred schools for an earlier 4:30 PM dismissal. Happiness.</p>

                <h2>THE GROWTH OF ALJOHN POLYGLOT AND WHY I HATED IT</h2>
                <p>Transferring schools, I continued my routine (with the AirPod trick). But now, YouTube took time. Videos went viral (1k -> 40k+ subs quickly). TV guestings, celebrity collabs. I was thankful, but it slowed my language learning to ~6 hours/day on school days.</p>
                <p>A part of me craved the 12-hour marathons, the intense focus. School was less hectic, but YouTube became the new enemy – hours spent scripting, recording, editing (all by myself). Finding an editor fluent in my specific niche languages and cultural references felt impossible.</p>
                <p>I still want to study, not be stuck in YouTube fame/money wasn't the goal. There's so much to learn – science, politics, psychology – time is slipping away. My teacher asked about post-graduation jobs. I said, "I don’t want a job. I want to be a student forever." Reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Leonardo da Vinci reinforced this: Leonardo learned for knowledge's sake, not salary. Today's system teaches obedience, not learning. I hate it here.</p>

                <h2>WHY SACRIFICE IS EVERYTHING</h2>
                <p>Learning fast requires sacrifice. Magnus Carlsen dedicated his life to chess. Kobe Bryant regretted missing family time, but without that sacrifice, would he have won 5 championships? There's no balance if you want to be extraordinary. Michael Phelps prioritized swimming over balance.</p>
                <p>Balance is a lie. Mediocrity is the result. I wanted fluency, settled for mediocre grades. I wanted perfect languages, let go of friends. I chose languages over everything, lost my Filipino identity. I become Spanish when speaking Spanish, French when French, etc.</p>
                <p>My YouTube isn't "shocking natives." It's fragmented identities. Recently, I disappeared for a month for intensive German learning, shutting down the world again. I learned it. That's the power of prioritizing.</p>
                <p>I find joy in studying. Trade it for birthdays or grades? Never. For YouTube fame? Don't care. For a $100k job without language practice? No thanks.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I dream of just me, my phone/PC, and the world burning outside. Another pandemic? Impossible now. But whatever happens, I’ll keep learning, because I’m not good enough.</p>
                <p>My name is Aljohn, thank you for reading.</p>
